But customer Aâ€™s network geographically spread between site 1 and site 2 the way CE-A1, CE-A2, CE-A3 and CE-A4 located in site 1 and CE-A5, CE-A6 and CE-A7 located in site 2. Therefore, customer A get L2VPN service from service provider to achieve connectivity. From the other hand customer B also have some requirement and getting L2VPN service from SP to achieve connectivity. To fulfill the requirement of this both customer and allow both of them to use same VLAN range to achieve connectivity SP use Q-in-Q Tunnels and Layer 2 Protocol Tunneling according to following figure.
